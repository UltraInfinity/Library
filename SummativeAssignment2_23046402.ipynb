        "1. **Adding New Notification Types:** The system can easily accommodate new notification types by creating new notification classes that inherit from a common base class.\n",

        "2. **Customization:** Allow customization of notification content to meet specific requirements, making the system more adaptable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Configurability:** Implement a configuration system for specifying notification triggers and recipients, enabling administrators to configure notifications without modifying the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Logging and Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling and logging for notification-related issues to improve reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Integration:** Consider integrating with external notification services for more advanced notification options.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Testing:** Develop a comprehensive testing framework to verify the correctness of notification logic and ensure that new notifications do not break existing functionality.\n",
